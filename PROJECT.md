# Emacs Configuration Development Log

## Project Overview
This project develops a comprehensive, modular Emacs configuration for cross-platform Linux development with support for multiple programming languages, Org-mode productivity features, and advanced IDE-like capabilities.

## Implementation Sessions

### Session 1: Initial Assessment and Feature Implementation (2025-08-07)

#### Changes Made

**1. Added LSP-Mode Support (`config-lsp.el`)**
- Configured `lsp-mode` with performance optimizations
- Added `lsp-ui` for enhanced user interface 
- Language server support for:
  - C/C++ with clangd
  - Rust with rust-analyzer (via rustic package)
  - Lua with lua-language-server
  - MATLAB with matlab-language-server
- Key bindings: `C-c l` prefix for LSP commands
- Integration with which-key for command hints

**2. Tree-sitter Configuration (`config-treesitter.el`)**
- Enabled tree-sitter for enhanced syntax highlighting
- Added support for multiple languages (C/C++, Rust, Lua, Python, JS, etc.)
- AST viewing functionality with `C-c t a` binding
- Debug mode support with `C-c t d` binding
- Tree-sitter indentation support
- Automatic activation for programming modes

**3. Enhanced Reading Mode (`config-ui.el`)**
- Improved olivetti-mode configuration
- Added automatic reading mode for org/markdown files
- Manual toggle with `C-c r` key binding
- Automatic disabling of line numbers in reading mode
- Integration with find-file-hook for automatic activation

**4. Comprehensive Proxy Management (`config-proxy.el`)**
- Automatic network environment detection
- Multiple proxy profiles (none, corporate, home)
- Network change detection and suggestions
- Proxy testing functionality
- Key bindings: `C-c p` prefix for proxy commands
- Background monitoring with configurable intervals
- Integration with package management

**5. Updated Core Configuration**
- Modified `init.el` to load new modules
- Maintained existing modular structure
- Preserved all existing functionality

#### Features Now Implemented âœ…
- **All original requirements**: toolbar/menubar disabled, line numbers, completion engine, etc.
- **New LSP features**: Language servers for C/C++, Rust, MATLAB, Lua
- **Tree-sitter**: Enhanced syntax highlighting and AST viewing
- **Reading mode**: Distraction-free reading for org/markdown
- **Proxy management**: Automatic detection and switching
- **Key hints**: Comprehensive which-key integration

#### Key Bindings Added
- `C-c l`: LSP commands (rename, format, find definition, etc.)
- `C-c t`: Tree-sitter commands (AST view, debug mode)
- `C-c r`: Reading mode toggle
- `C-c p`: Proxy management commands

#### Files Modified/Created
- **Modified**: `init.el`, `lisp/config-ui.el`
- **Created**: `lisp/config-lsp.el`, `lisp/config-treesitter.el`, `lisp/config-proxy.el`
- **Created**: `PROJECT.md` (this file)

#### Dependencies Required
The following packages will be automatically installed on first run:
- `lsp-mode`, `lsp-ui` - Language server support
- `tree-sitter`, `tree-sitter-langs` - Enhanced syntax highlighting
- `rustic` - Rust development support
- `lua-mode` - Lua development support  
- `matlab-mode` - MATLAB development support

#### System Dependencies
External tools needed for full functionality:
- `clangd` - C/C++ language server
- `rust-analyzer` - Rust language server
- `lua-language-server` - Lua language server
- `matlab-language-server` - MATLAB language server (optional)

## Next Steps
1. Test configuration with `emacs --debug-init`
2. Install required external language servers
3. Verify all key bindings work as expected
4. Test proxy detection on different networks
5. Validate tree-sitter functionality across supported languages

## Development Process Notes
- Configuration maintains modular structure for maintainability
- All new features integrate with existing which-key setup
- Performance optimizations applied to LSP configuration
- Backward compatibility preserved for existing workflows
- Cross-platform considerations implemented for proxy detection

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Emacs starts without errors
- [ ] LSP activates for supported languages
- [ ] Tree-sitter highlighting works
- [ ] Reading mode toggles correctly
- [ ] Proxy detection functions properly
- [ ] All key bindings responsive
- [ ] Dashboard and existing features unchanged
